	<!--Introductory Paragraph-->
	<div class="intro-paragraphs"
	<p id="intro">Welcome to the Artist's Block. My name is Imaad Mian. I am currently a candidate for a BMath at the University of Waterloo and a BBA at Wilfrid Laurier. I have always enjoyed learning new skills and practicing them as best I can and this website is the product of all that practice. Over the last 2 years I founded my brand <em>Mian Studios</em> as a creative production company. This included photography, videography and audio production that I did for clients as well as clubs in my high school. Simultaneously, I started the <a href="soundcloud.com/artistblockpod">Artist's Block Podcast</a>, a podcast about passionate youth to help inspire listeners of my age group to get out there and try new things. The idea of Artist's Block has always been important to me, it's the state of an artist's mind in which they are the least creative, unable to get out of a rut. This is a humbling experience for artists everywhere whenever they hit that block for the first time. Nevertheless, the name holds up on this site.

	<p id="intro-part2">
	This website was coded completely from scratch as a chance for me to learn more about HMTL and CSS and come into my own as a web developer. I believe that I will be able to utilize these skills for any employment I seek in the future. It was great fun going through the process of learning a vast language and I'd personally recommend having a project in mind for all starting developers. Without a project, you'll find yourself not knowing what you need to know to complete anything. I give all the credit to the folks over at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy</a> for an excellent course to follow.</p>

<!--All of this was for the test version of the website practicing with lists and such.
	<div class="lists">
		<h3 class="list-headings">Three Main Goals for the Site:
		</h3>
		<ol class="list-items" id="goals-list-items">
				<li>A Resume</li>
				<li>Coding and Creative Portfolios</li>
				<li>Personal Blog</li>
			</ol>
	</div>	

	<p class="intro-paragraphs" id="intro-part3">Now I understand that this entire project could have been done <em>much</em> easier with web tools. 
		Frankly, I don't see the value in letting another service do all the work for you, this is better. 
		Here are a few reasons why I believe coding this myself is a better idea than automation.</p>

	<div class="lists">
		<h3  class="list-headings">Reasons to Code from Scratch:</h3>
		<ul class="list-items">
			<li>Resume points</li>
			<li>Creative Freedom</li>
			<li>More precise process</li>
			<li>Greater Appreciation</li>
		</ul>
