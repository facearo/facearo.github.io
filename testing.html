	<p id="intro">Welcome to the Artist's Block! My name is Imaad Mian and I am the creator of the <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/artistblockpod">Artist's Block Podcast</a>. 
	The original podcast was meant to be a platform for youth to discover new passions by hearing from some 
	 of their peers who have experience in the arts, community organizations and more!
	This website is different because it's going to be more about myself: my interests, my qualifications and so forth. And this will hopefully be done completely from scratch :)
	</p>

	<p id="intro-part2">
	What I've learned over my short years of coding is the importance of <strong> having a goal in mind. </strong> 
		Without a goal for learning, it's hard to figure out what to learn, languages are vast! 
		For this site, here are my main goals and what I want this to site to look like.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="lists">
		<h3 class="list-headings">Three Main Goals for the Site:
		</h3>
		<ol class="list-items" id="goals-list-items">
				<li>A Resume</li>
				<li>Coding and Creative Portfolios</li>
				<li>Personal Blog</li>
			</ol>
	</div>	

	<p class="intro-paragraphs" id="intro-part3">Now I understand that this entire project could have been done <em>much</em> easier with web tools. 
		Frankly, I don't see the value in letting another service do all the work for you, this is better. 
		Here are a few reasons why I believe coding this myself is a better idea than automation.</p>

	<div class="lists">
		<h3  class="list-headings">Reasons to Code from Scratch:</h3>
		<ul class="list-items">
			<li>Resume points</li>
			<li>Creative Freedom</li>
			<li>More precise process</li>
			<li>Greater Appreciation</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
		<h3 id="goal">Project completion date: End of Summer 2020</h3>
