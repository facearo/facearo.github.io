		Funny story, in the 2nd or 3rd grade I had this obsession with making my own website and having a blog and games on it. 2nd or 3rd grade! I remember travelling to my home country Pakistan and begging my cousin to setup a domain for myself. Sure enough, he complied and my first website was born. I wish I could remember what that domain was or what that website actually did but all I remember is that it once did exist. Some of my friends from that period still rememeber the existence of the site to this day.
		</p>

		<p class="post-body">
		I point to that story as one of the main inspirations to finally designing this website and code it myself. It didn't take too long, about 2-3 weeks I believe have passed by so far and I'm proud of how this has come along. With my interests, I've always been all over the place. I am a creative person who somehow really likes math. This website is my time capsule as I progress through life and hopefully continue to update this as often as I feel. It may not have that much appeal to outside users (unless you are an employer doing a background check, in that case, hello!) so it is a personal project. If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by, enjoy your stay while you surf through the web.

		<p class="post-body">
		So, my advice to you thinking of starting a new blog and for some reason coming to this specific website? Make sure you know what reason you're doing it for, and then accept those reasons. Don't lie to yourself. If you think you want to dive in and build sites by learning code, go for it, just don't act like it's for a job if it isn't. Don't be afraid to use Wix or SquareSpace out of fear that those aren't as professional. They will always look more professional than something made from an amateur programmer.
		</p>

		<p class="post-body">
		Whatever you choose to do, always stay true to yourself and make sure you have fun with it. If it wasn't enjoyable, you're never going to get it done.
